## 🧠 Project Overview

SmartGrade AI addresses common challenges in academic monitoring such as:

- Manual grading analysis
- Lack of predictive insights
- Limited centralized tracking

Through a seamless and interactive interface, SmartGrade AI allows users to:

- Manage student records
- Train machine learning models
- Make predictions
- Generate insightful reports

All features are backed by structured data storage and AI logic.

## 🗃️ Database Design

SmartGrade AI uses a well-normalized relational schema to:

- Maintain consistency
- Avoid redundancy
- Improve query performance

### Main Entities:
- `Students`
- `Attendance`
- `Assignments`
- `Exams`
- `Predictions`

The Entity-Relationship (ER) model clearly defines how these components interact.
